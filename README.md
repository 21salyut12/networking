# Networking projects

## About the repository
This repository contains networking related projects created in Packet Tracer through which I practice various topics such as dynamic routing protocols, access lists and subnetting.
The goal of this repository is to showcase my technical skills and understanding of the networking concepts practiced in the created scenarios.
Each subdirectory contains the documentation for the its corresponding Packet Tracer scenario, an overview of the topology and the .pkt file of the project.
